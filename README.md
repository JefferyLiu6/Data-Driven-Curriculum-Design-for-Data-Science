# Bridging the Gap: Industry-Driven Data Science Curriculum Design 📘💻

## Context 🌟
With the rapid growth of the data science field, aligning academic programs with industry needs is essential. Employers seek a blend of technical, analytical, and interpersonal skills, but traditional curriculums often fail to meet these evolving demands. This project addresses the challenge by analyzing job postings to identify critical skills and employing clustering techniques to design an actionable, industry-aligned curriculum.

## Problem Statement 🧩
**How can we design a data science curriculum that aligns with the ever-evolving demands of the job market while providing students with a clear and logical pathway for skill acquisition?**

---

## Objective 🎯
This project focuses on:
1. Analyzing job postings for data-related roles to identify high-demand skills.
2. Grouping these skills into meaningful clusters using clustering techniques.
3. Creating a structured, industry-relevant curriculum for aspiring data professionals.

## Methodology 🚀

### 1. Job Posting Analysis
- **Data Collection**: Scraped 1,276 job postings from Canadian and remote locations, surpassing the target of 800. Anti-bot measures were addressed with custom scripts.
- **Preprocessing**: Removed duplicates, standardized text, and prepared a clean dataset for analysis.

### 2. Skill Extraction
- **Text Analysis**: Combined job descriptions into a single corpus and extracted unigrams and bigrams using `CountVectorizer`.
- **Skill Validation**: Enhanced the extracted skills using AI-powered validation via ChatGPT to ensure relevance and eliminate noise.

### 3. Clustering
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Used cosine similarity and centroid linkage to form distinct skill clusters.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Applied the Elbow Method to identify optimal cluster numbers and validate groupings.
- **Comparison**: Evaluated hierarchical vs. K-Means clustering for curriculum design, balancing granularity and coherence.

### 4. Curriculum Design
- **Skill-Based Courses**: Developed a 10-course curriculum based on skill clusters, ensuring logical progression and minimal redundancy.
- **Industry Relevance**: Included foundational programming, advanced machine learning, big data tools, and business intelligence skills.
